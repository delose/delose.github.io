# 🌐 Microservices Architecture: The Foundation of Scalability and Modularity in Personal Finance Management
The application's backbone is its microservice architecture, which ensures that every functionality can be developed and deployed independently (e.g., expense tracking, investment analysis). This architectural style empowers the team to scale specific parts without affecting the entire system ([source code](https://github.com/delose/personal-finance-management-system/blob/main/src/microservice-setup.js)).
```javascript
// Example of how you might reference a snippet from src/microservices-setup.js for illustration: (This is an imaginary code block, replace with actual content if available)
function startServices() {
  const expenseService = createExpenseMicroservice(); // Start the Expense Tracking Service
  ...
}
```

## 🔥 Memoization Technique: Boost Performance in Financial Projections
```javascript
// Example of the custom decorator function from lib/utils/memoizeDecorator.js:
export default async function memoize(func) { ... }

@memoize  // Usage in a component or utility file where performance optimization matters, for example (replace with real code reference):
const expensiveComputation = React.useCallback(() => computeFinancialProjection(), [...]);
```

# 💾 State Management: Elegant Global Data Handling with Context API
```javascript
// Simplified representation of using Context API for state management in React (replace this pseudocode block):
const UserStateContext = createContext({ ... });
export default function App() {
    return (
        <UserStateContext.Provider value={userFinancialData}>
            <Dashboard />
            ...
        </UserStateContext.Provider>
```
